### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7 was one of my favorite labs as I know how to play Blackjack and being able to create a game that I was able to play was very fun. I enjoy making games so this lab was automatically one of my favorites.

* Lab 4

   Lab 4 was also one of my favorites as it was the first one I struggled with a bit. The satisfaction when I was able to get it done was one of the reasons this lab was one of my favorites. Also creating a date calculator although not a game was still pretty cool.

* Lab 3

  Growing up I really liked Mad Libs and being able to create a mini version of it was pretty exciting. I think this is probably my favorite lab out of the three. It was fun being able to test this one out.
